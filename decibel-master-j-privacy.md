# Privacy Policy for Decibel Master J

**Effective Date:** 2025-07-14 
Thank you for choosing Decibel Master J ("the App"). This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand what information the App accesses, how it is used, and to assure you that your privacy is respected and protected.

### Our Core Privacy Principle

Decibel Master J is built with privacy as a top priority. The App is designed to function entirely on your device. We do not have servers, and we do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.

### 1. Information We Access

**Microphone Access:**
The primary function of Decibel Master J is to measure sound levels in your environment. To perform this function, the App requires one-time permission to access your device's microphone.

*   **How Microphone Data is Processed:** The audio stream from your microphone is analyzed **in real-time and exclusively on your device** to calculate the decibel level.
*   **No Recording or Storage:** We want to be unequivocally clear: **The App does not record, save, or store any audio.** The audio data is processed instantaneously for calculation and is immediately and permanently discarded.
*   **No Transmission:** The App **does not transmit any audio data** off your device. All calculations happen locally. Your conversations and ambient sounds remain completely private to you.

### 2. Information We Store Locally

Decibel Master J stores a minimal amount of non-personal data on your device to enhance your user experience. This data is stored using Apple's standard `UserDefaults` system and remains on your device. We do not have access to it.

*   **Calibration Offset:** When you use the calibration feature in the settings, the numerical offset value you set (e.g., `-2.5 dB`) is saved. This data is anonymous and is used solely to adjust the measurement calculations according to your preference.

### 3. What We DO NOT Collect

To be perfectly clear, Decibel Master J **DOES NOT** collect, access, or transmit any of the following:

*   Personally Identifiable Information (such as your name, email address, or phone number).
*   Location data.
*   Device identifiers or advertising identifiers.
*   Contacts, photos, or any other personal content on your device.
*   Usage analytics or crash reports.

The App does not include any third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking mechanisms.

### 4. Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. The App's functionality is safe for all ages, and since no data is collected, children's privacy is inherently protected.

### 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.

### 6. Contact Us

If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback regarding this Privacy Policy, please do not hesitate to contact us.
